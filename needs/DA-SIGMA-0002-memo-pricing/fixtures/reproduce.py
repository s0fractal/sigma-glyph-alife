"""DA-SIGMA-0002 — minimal reproducer. Depends on Book I and nothing else.

Four claims, in order:

  R1  The ACCOUNTING is identical on a second evaluation: the same hash costs
      the same both times. NOTE, corrected 2026-08-26: this says nothing about
      whether an implementation re-does the WORK. Book I §3.4 settles that
      explicitly — "sharing MAY be used in execution, but reported ATP MUST match
      tree accounting" — so a conforming implementation may already take the
      result from a memo and must still report the tree price. An earlier draft
      of this packet read R1 as "Book I never reuses a result", which is a
      different and false claim.
  R2  A memo of normal forms priced at `size(nf)` reaches the SAME result hash
      for every fixture term, spends materially less, and satisfies §3.4's
      `size <= spent + 1` at every action.
  R3  The price has TWO floors, one below the other, and they answer different
      questions. `size(nf) - 1` is where the memory bound `size <= spent + 1`
      itself starts to fail; `size(nf)` is where a memo install stops obeying the
      per-row discipline every Book I action satisfies (`dsize <= cost - 1`).
      Both boundaries are measured here.
  R4  What a DIFFERENT accounting would report. A run that charges size(nf) for
      an installed normal form reports a different atp_spent for the same
      (term, budget), and therefore cannot satisfy conformance vectors that pin
      spend. That is not a defect in Book I: §3.4 requires the tree figure to be
      reported, so this is a measurement of what an ALife-side metabolic
      accounting would look like, and of why it must not be called Σ-GLYPH
      atp_spent. It does NOT follow that warrant's ski@v1 verdicts diverge:
      SPEC §3.1 compares the result NodeHash against `expect` and pins `atp` as
      an INPUT budget; it does not compare spend.
